 <h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>
 <p> When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.  </p>

 <p>At five, I <a href="https://starzit.com/">marveled</a>  at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. </p>
 <p>When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas.</p> 
 <p>At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in <a href="https://starzit.com/"> Starz University </a> </p>
<p> It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language. </p>

<p>It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was.</p>
<p>But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.</p>

<p>In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities with English through cognates.</p>
<p>Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. </p> 
<p>This was incredible to 
me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.</p> <a href="milto:jeffreykelvinho@gmail.com">Send Us Email </a></p>
<p>Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese.As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost.</p>
<p>I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. </p>
<p>I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them. </p>
